# PWA boiler plate

Use it, if you wish, for your PWA PoC.

PWA needs a web server to run. We can't run it from a 'file://' URL. So this boiler plate includes a minimal Node.js/Express developing server.

You need to install Node.js and NPM in your computer. I recomend to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for does it.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
## Using

```bash
node index.js
```

Open PWA in http://localhost:3000/
